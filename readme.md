### Motivation

I stood this Google API JavaScript Client Library integration up for a client and thought I would strip it down and share it.

### Installation

Copy and Paste easy.

:hand: PREREQUISITE: You must have your Blogger posts published, have an API Key, and enable the Blogger API in the Google API Manager.  These arguments are required to call the API.
⚠️ If you enable key restriction be sure and include your domain without any wildcards in addition to the wildcard entry.
The easiest way to install this example is to copy and paste it, or clone it.
